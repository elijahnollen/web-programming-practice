                        Hi! I’m <strong> Elijah Crisehea M. Nollen </strong>, you can call me Eli. A student passionate about analytics and turning data into actionable insights. I enjoy exploring patterns and solving problems. Fun fact: Computer Science wasn’t my first choice, I initially wanted to study Industrial Engineering. But thanks to a scholarship from SM, I ended up in Computer Science, and I’ve grown to love the field even more! Outside of academics, I enjoy reading books and watching movies.
